# AngularJss

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

In this project, you can see an unusual implementation of JSS (usualy JSS is used with React) with Angular to test CSS-IN-JS (in this case, in TypeScript) using Angular.

This test is based in this Medium Post, by Kim T: `https://medium.com/creative-technology-concepts-code/css-in-javascript-with-angular-61da79111804` with some changes.  Just run `ng serve` and enjoy it.

## Where is the code?

Just go to `app` and check this 3 files: `app.component.ts`, `app.component.html` and `app.component.styles.ts`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
